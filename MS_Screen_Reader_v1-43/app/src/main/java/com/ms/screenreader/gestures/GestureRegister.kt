/**
 * Every gesture "slot" (register) that Android's accessibility gesture
 * detector can report to us, across 1 to 4 fingers. This is the full
 * pool a per-app gesture scheme can pick from.
 *
 * Why this exists separately from [GestureManager]:
 * [GestureManager] only knows about the 12 single-finger gestures that
 * are wired to *global* actions today. This enum additionally covers:
 *  - the 4 single-finger "reversal" gestures Android supports; two are
 *    now wired to global actions (swipe up-then-down / down-then-up
 *    cycle the reading granularity - see GestureManager and
 *    ReadingGranularity), the other two (left-then-right,
 *    right-then-left) are still unused
 *  - all 2/3/4-finger swipes and taps, which Android only detects as
 *    straight up/down/left/right (no diagonal/L-shaped multi-finger
 *    gestures exist on the platform - that shape is 1-finger only)
 *
 * Each entry stores the raw Android gesture-id int (stable public API
 * constants from AccessibilityService) plus how many fingers it takes,
 * so storage/UI code can group and label them without re-deriving this
 * mapping each time.
