/**
 * Thin wrapper around Android's TextToSpeech engine.
 * Buffers a single pending utterance if speak() is called before the
 * engine finishes initializing, so early accessibility events right
 * after the service starts aren't silently dropped.
 *
 * Speech volume is independent from music volume: TTS output is routed
 * to Android's dedicated STREAM_ACCESSIBILITY audio stream (see
 * setAudioAttributes() in onInit) instead of the default STREAM_MUSIC.
 * This is the same mechanism TalkBack uses (confirmed both in
 * TalkBack's own AOSP source and in Android's official accessibility-
 * service guide, which explicitly recommends it for screen readers) -
 * requires two things working together, both API 26+ (this app's
 * minSdk is already 26):
 *  1. accessibility_service_config.xml declares
 *     flagEnableAccessibilityVolume.
 *  2. The audio actually played by the service uses
 *     AudioAttributes.USAGE_ASSISTANCE_ACCESSIBILITY (set here for TTS,
 *     and already set in SoundSchemeManager for earcons).
 * With both in place, Android automatically treats the accessibility
 * stream as "the currently active/most relevant stream" while this
 * service is speaking or playing an earcon - so a volume-key press at
 * that moment adjusts STREAM_ACCESSIBILITY, and the system volume
 * panel shows it as a separate "Accessibility volume" slider. The
 * instant nothing is speaking/earcon-ing, volume keys go back to
 * controlling whatever else is relevant (music, ringer, etc.) as
 * normal - there's no separate "focus a slider first" step needed, and
 * no code here decides *when* volume keys apply to which stream; the
 * system does that automatically based on what's making sound.
